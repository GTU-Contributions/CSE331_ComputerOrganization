The Instruction memory is set at mips_testbench.v
After running the testbench 2 txt format output is created:

_registerContent.txt - content of the registers after the execution of the instructions
_mainMemoryContent.txt - content of the memory after the execution of the instructions

Please set the path for:
data.mem
instruction.mem
registers.mem

otherwise the program may not compile.
